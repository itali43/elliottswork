<p id="noteTitle">Aleo Cover Note - Dev Relations</p>

<div id="noteSubtitle">Who I am, and why Aleo</div>

<div id="noteBody">
  I have been working in cryptocurrency/tech since 2013. I have
  <a href="/index.html">varied experience</a>, knowing the space as an
  enthusiast, sales engineer, a crypto fund dev, a solidity + full stack dev,
  team lead, and mechanism designer. These roles have made me flexible and
  results-oriented: I have deep knowledge throughout the technical stack and
  especially in cryptocurrency.

<div id="noteBody">
  Viv turned me onto Aleo a while ago. I've been impressed and excited by the
  technical mission for a while. Privacy and zk are the future of crypto. I
  think I'm a good fit for the culture, based on meeting Viv's co-workers at
  events and talking with her about the company. Given my experience and
  skillset, I am particularly well-suited to help with the things that are
  coming up pre- and post- launch. I'd enjoy continuing to grow the dev
  community and ecosystem resources around Leo, etc. and furthering the Aleo
  mission.

<div id="noteSubtitle">What to do</div>

<div id="noteBody">
  The overarching goal, as with any blockchain project, is to have consistent
  and numerous users, as a blockchain isn't secure without them. Dev share is
  crucial for product success, and that comes from happy, informed developers.
  <br />
  <br />

  This is a brief outline of how I'd approach achieving this goal:
  <br />
  <br />

  <ui>
    <li>
      For data-driven outcomes (to monitor success of outreach/growth):
      <ui
        ><li style="margin-left: 60px">
          Focus on churn in github analytics (impressions, forks, etc)
        </li>
        <li style="margin-left: 60px">Package manager installs of the sdk</li>
        <li style="margin-left: 60px">Youtube video click thrus</li></ui
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      Pump out and promote How-To's, step-by-steps, and tutorials for using Leo
      / operating with Aleo.
    </li>
    <li>Hype and inform at conferences</li>
    <li>
      Segment users into node operators, users, and light node
      operators/applications; then provide content for each
    </li>
  </ui>
  <br />
  Look forward to speaking more about this with you soon,
  <br />
  Elliott
