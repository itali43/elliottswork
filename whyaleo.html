<p id="noteTitle">Aleo Note - Dev Relations</p>

<div id="noteSubtitle">Who I am, and why Aleo</div>

<div id="noteBody">
  I have been working in cryptocurrency/tech since 2013. I have varied
  experience, knowing the space as an ethusiast, sales engineer, a crypto fund
  dev, a solidity + full stack dev, team lead, and mechanism designer. These
  roles have made me flexible and results-oriented, with I have deep knowledge
  throughout the technical stack and especially in cryptocurrency.
  <br />

<div id="noteBody">
  Viv turned me onto Aleo a while ago. I've been impressed with and excited by
  the technical mission for a while, privacy and zk are the future of crypto. I
  think I'm a good fit for the culture (based on meeting Viv's co-workers at
  events). I think the things that are coming up pre- and post- launch I'm
  particularly well-suited to help with given my experience and skillset. I'd
  enjoy growing the dev community around Leo, etc. and further building out the
  ecosystem, furthering the Aleo mission.

<div id="noteSubtitle">What to do</div>

<div id="noteBody">
  The overarching goal, as with any blockchain, is to have consistent and
  numerous users, as a blockchain isn't secure without them. Dev share is
  crucial for product success, and that comes from happy, informed developers.
  <br />
  <br />

  Were we to start working together, this is a brief outline of how I'd approach
  achieving this goal:
  <br />
  <br />

  <ui>
    <li>
      For data-driven outcomes (to monitor success of outreach/growth):
      <ui
        ><li style="margin-left: 60px">
          Focus on churn in github analytics (impressions, forks, etc)
        </li>
        <li style="margin-left: 60px">Package manager installs of the sdk</li>
        <li style="margin-left: 60px">Youtube video click thrus</li></ui
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      Pump out and promote How-To's, step-by-steps, and tutorials for using Leo
      / operating with Aleo.
    </li>
    <li>Hype and inform at conferences</li>
    <li>
      Segment users into node operators, users, and light node
      operators/applications; then provide content for each
    </li>
  </ui>
  <br />
