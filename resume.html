  Went to USMA for 2.2 years, jumped out of some helicopters among many other things, decided I preferred a slightly less structured environment.
  Graduated from IU with a Finance BS and minor in Math.
  Drove out to SF in 2013 to work in the bitcoin space.
  Contracted, interned twice over, and ended up selling bug bounty programs with Cobalt.
  Wanted to be closer to product so taught myself to code and started picking up iOS projects.
  Active professionally in the bitcoin then crypto space throughout career, most contracts crypto related.
  Suggested a book on risk mgmt and a book on market making to the first (as far as I know) purely crypto hedge fund in 2014.
  Ended up working for another crypto hedge fund that was using their stack, working on gryphon, old wallet software, and front end web dev.
  Teamed up with Gryphon founder to provide hedge fund backend consulting using gryphon.  Gryphon Labs.  Catered to funds ranging in size from $4M to $1B.  Responsibilities included: Client custom dev work, documentation, sales engineer work.

  Worked on AI model for a YC-backed edtech company during the pandemic.  Was a fun diversion.

  Did more trading contracting work post-pandemic, including implementation of custom and hummingbot platforms.

  Worked with a real estate tech company on fractionalizing Real Estate on the ETH blockchain.  Learned more about securities law, jurisdictions, and different crypto network ad/disadvantages than I thought possible.

  Built a successful Web3 Gaming NFTs (player equipment, characters and soulbound user badges).


  Have been doing degen shitcoining, node implementations, and personal projects since. -->

          Used Gryphon for the hedge fund's backend, decided with the architect
